📌 Overview

This project is a complete end-to-end Machine Learning + Web Application, developed during my InternPe Internship.

The application predicts the market value of a used car based on key vehicle attributes using a regression-based Machine Learning model, and delivers real-time predictions through a clean, responsive Flask web interface.

The project demonstrates real-world ML deployment, clean backend architecture, and production-style design principles, making it suitable for academic evaluation, internships, and professional portfolios.

🚀 Key Features
🔍 Machine Learning

Cleans and preprocesses real-world used-car data

Handles both numerical and categorical features

Regression-based car price prediction

Fallback median-based estimation to ensure system stability

Easily extendable to Random Forest, XGBoost, and other advanced models

🌐 Web Application

Flask backend with organized routing

Clean, responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

Supports:

Traditional Form POST predictions

AJAX-based real-time predictions (no page reload)

Error-safe design for a smooth and reliable user experience

🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
🧹 Data Preprocessing

Converts kilometer strings → numerical values

Standardizes manufacturer names

Normalizes fuel-type labels

Removes outliers for improved prediction stability

🔮 Prediction Logic

Primary ML regression model predicts the car price

If unseen or unstable inputs are encountered, a fallback formula ensures reliability:

predicted_price = median_price × age_factor × kms_factor


This design guarantees robust predictions without system failure, even for edge cases.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Car-Price-Prediction.git
cd AI-Car-Price-Prediction

2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Train the Model (Optional)
python train.py

5️⃣ Run the Application
python app.py


Open your browser and navigate to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/

🎮 How the Application Works

User enters car details:

Manufacturer

Kilometers Driven

Fuel Type

Car Age

Data is sent to the Flask backend via:

Form POST, or

AJAX JSON request

The ML model processes the inputs and predicts the car price

The result is displayed:

Instantly (AJAX), or

On a results page (Form submission)
